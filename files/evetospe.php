		<p>We strive to develop a greater understanding of the abilities and challenges individuals with autism face.

		Such efforts lead to more opportunities for individuals with autism to achieve their fullest potential and, together with their families, experience a true sense of belonging.  Many businesses and public spaces are now adapting their services to become more ‘autism friendly’ but there is a still a long way to go for real acceptance and understanding.

		We recognize that autism is more than a simple statistic and a puzzle piece. There are many issues that are can be complex and require more in-depth discussion.  We invite you to read our articles and explore our website to understand these issues more fully.
