		<h1>Family</h1>
		<p>Family life is all about relationships and communication: relationships between two people in love, parents and children, siblings, extended family members. Yet, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are all about communication challenges, misunderstanding of social cues, and lack of emotional understanding, thus affecting every relationship in the family.
			
		Our website provides families with specific and important information about autism treatment and services available in the world.

		The website is a valuable and reliable resource for up-to-date facts and findings about autism and often acts as the first line of support for parents as well as a starting point for navigating services in different part of the world.
