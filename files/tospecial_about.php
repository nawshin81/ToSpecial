		<div class="list_about">
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>A better understanding of the causes and typology of ASD</li>
		<li>Children with an autism spectrum disorder being diagnosed as soon as posible</li>
		<li>Children having access to appropriate intervention, services and resources immediately following diagnosis</li>
		<li>The availability of better treatments and education for the children</li>
		<li>To find out the latent talent of the thildren with an autism spectrum disorder and to upkeep their talent</li>
		<li>These goals can only be achieved through work in communities nationwide, at the federal level and globally by working with partners, governments and other organizations</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
		<p>It will require an inclusive approach that values diversity and individual needs. We will work in partnership with those who share our goals, ambitions, and values.

		It is clear that the mission of To Special will require the organization to grow in new ways and build capacity to be a sustaining organization to accelerate progress in science and support people with autism and their families over a lifetime. 

		This will require investment in people, infrastructure and process in order to operate as a best in class non-profit organization.
