		<p> It is important to differentiate between treatment/therapy and recreation. Some of the activities which are not established as evidence-based practices for autism may be enjoyable to individuals and valuable as reinforcers  or leisure activities. 
		However, they do not qualify as therapeutic treatment unless they directly alleviate the challenges of autism, teach skills, or reduce challenging behavior.

		To Special understands that any one individual may respond well to an intervention that is not documented as effective for the majority of people with autism. As with any intervention, we recommend collecting and analyzing data regularly to assess progress with the treatment team. Being alert to possible side effects is also important.
